check if Kinect sensor is detected from Device Manager. May need a few times retry.


Video data from the Kinect sensor includes low-level data, such as infrared and color, as well as processed data, like depth and body (commonly referred to as skeleton). 

The DepthFrame Class represents a frame where each pixel represents the distance of the closest object seen by that pixel. The data for this frame is stored as 16-bit unsigned integers, where each value represents the distance in millimeters. The maximum depth distance is 8 meters, although reliability starts to degrade at around 4.5 meters. Developers can use the depth frame to build custom tracking algorithms in cases where the BodyFrame Class isnâ€™t enough.

The BodyFrame Class contains all the computed real-time tracking information about people that are in view of the sensor. The computed info includes skeletal joints and orientations, hand states, and more for up to 6 people at a time.
